	<p>This section is <a class="termref" href="terms#def_informative">informative</a>.</p>
	<p>The goals of this specification include:</p>
	<ul><li>expanding the accessibility information that may be supplied by the author;</li><li>requiring that supporting host languages provide full keyboard support that may be implemented in a device-independent way, for example, by telephones, handheld devices, e-book readers, and televisions;</li><li>improving the accessibility of dynamic content generated by scripts; and</li><li>providing for interoperability with <a href="terms#def_at" class="termref">assistive technologies</a>.</li></ul>
	<p>WAI-ARIA is a technical specification that provides a framework to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. This document is primarily for developers creating custom widgets and other web application components. Please see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA Overview</a> for links to related documents for other audiences, such as the WAI-ARIA Primer that introduces developers to the accessibility problems that WAI-ARIA is intended to solve, the fundamental concepts, and the technical approach of WAI-ARIA.</p>
	<p>This draft currently handles two aspects of <a href="terms#def_role" class="termref">roles</a>: user interface functionality and structural <a href="terms#def_relationship" class="termref">relationships</a>. For more information and use cases, see the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-wai-aria-primer-20100916/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Primer</a></cite> [<cite><a href="references#ref_ARIA-PRIMER">ARIA-PRIMER</a></cite>] for the use of roles in making interactive content accessible.</p>
	<p>The role <a href="terms#def_taxonomy" class="termref">taxonomy</a> is designed in part to support the common roles found in platform <a href="terms#def_accessibility_api" class="termref">accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">APIs</abbr></a>. Reference to roles found in this taxonomy by dynamic web content may be used to support interoperability with assistive technologies.</p>
	<p>The schema to support this standard has been designed to be extensible so that custom roles can be created by extending base roles. This allows <a href="terms#def_useragent" class="termref">user agents</a> to support at least the base role, and user agents that support the custom role can provide enhanced access. Note that much of this could be formalized in <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-0-20041028/">XML Schema</a></cite> [<cite><a class="nref" href="references#ref_XSD">XSD</a></cite>]. However, being able to define similarities between roles, such as <a href="roles#baseConcept">baseConcepts</a> and more descriptive definitions, would not be available in <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language Schema Datatypes">XSD</abbr>.</p>

		<p>The domain of web accessibility defines how to make web content usable by persons with disabilities. Persons with certain types of disabilities use <a href="terms#def_at" class="termref">assistive technologies</a> (<abbr title="Assistive Technologies">AT</abbr>) to interact with content. Assistive technologies can transform the presentation of content into a format more suitable to the user, and can allow the user to interact in different ways. For example, the user may need to, or choose to, interact with a slider widget via arrow keys, instead of dragging and dropping with a mouse. In order to accomplish this effectively, the software needs to understand the <a href="terms#def_semantics" class="termref">semantics</a> of the content. Semantics is the science of meaning; in this case, used to assign roles, states, and properties that apply to user interface and content elements as a human would understand. For instance, if a paragraph is semantically identified as such, assistive technologies can interact with it as a unit separable from the rest of the content, knowing the exact boundaries of that paragraph. An adjustable range slider or collapsible list (a.k.a. a tree <a href="terms#def_widget" class="termref">widget</a>) are more complex examples, in which various parts of the widget have semantics that need to be properly identified for assistive technologies to support effective interaction.</p>
		<p>New technologies often overlook semantics required for accessibility, and new authoring practices often misuse the intended semantics of those technologies. <a href="terms#def_element" class="termref">Elements</a> that have one defined meaning in the language are used with a different meaning intended to be understood by the user.</p>
		<p>For example, web application developers create collapsible tree widgets in HTML using CSS and JavaScript even though HTML has no semantic <code>tree</code> element. To a non-disabled user, it may look and act like a collapsible tree widget, but without appropriate semantics, the tree widget may not be <a href="terms#def_perceivable" class="termref">perceivable</a> to, or <a href="terms#def_object" class="termref">operable</a> by, a person with a disability because assistive technologies may not recognize the role.</p>
		<p>The incorporation of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is a way for an author to provide proper semantics for custom widgets to make these widgets accessible, usable, and interoperable with assistive technologies. This specification identifies the types of widgets and structures that are commonly recognized by accessibility products, by providing an <a href="terms#def_ontology" class="termref">ontology</a> of corresponding <a href="terms#def_role" class="termref">roles</a> that can be attached to content. This allows elements with a given role to be understood as a particular widget or structural type regardless of any semantic inherited from the implementing host language. Roles are a common property of platform <a href="terms#def_accessibility_api" class="termref">accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">APIs</abbr></a> which assistive technologies use to provide the user with effective presentation and interaction.</p>
		<p>This role <a href="terms#def_taxonomy" class="termref">taxonomy</a> includes interaction <a class="termref" href="terms#def_widget">widgets</a> and elements denoting document structure. The role taxonomy describes inheritance and details the <a href="terms#def_attribute" class="termref">attributes</a> each role supports. Information about mapping of roles to accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">APIs</abbr> is provided by the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-wai-aria-implementation-20140320/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> User Agent Implementation Guide</a></cite> [<cite><a href="references#ref_ARIA-IMPLEMENTATION">ARIA-IMPLEMENTATION</a></cite>].</p>
		<p>Roles are element types and will not change with time or user actions. Role information is used by assistive technologies, through interaction with the user agent, to provide normal processing of the specified element type.</p>
		<p>States and properties are used to declare important attributes of an element that affect and describe interaction. They enable the <a href="terms#def_useragent" class="termref">user agent</a> and operating system to properly handle the element even when the attributes are dynamically changed by client-side scripts. For example, alternative input and output technology, such as screen readers and speech dictation software, need to be able to recognize and effectively manipulated and communicate various interaction states (e.g., disabled, checked) to the user.</p>
		<p>While it is possible for assistive technologies to access these properties directly through the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113/">Document Object Model</a></cite> [<cite><a href="references#ref_DOM">DOM</a></cite>], the preferred mechanism is for the user agent to map the states and properties to the accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">API</abbr> of the operating system. See the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-wai-aria-implementation-20140320/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> User Agent Implementation Guide</a></cite> [<cite><a href="references#ref_ARIA-IMPLEMENTATION">ARIA-IMPLEMENTATION</a></cite>] for details.</p>
		<p id="desc_contractmodel">Figure 1.0 illustrates the relationship between user agents (e.g., browsers), accessibility APIs, and assistive technologies. It describes the "contract" provided by the user agent to assistive technologies, which includes typical accessibility information found in the accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">API</abbr> for many of our accessible platforms for GUIs (role, state, selection, <a href="terms#def_event" class="termref">event</a> notification, <a href="terms#def_relationship" class="termref">relationship</a> information, and descriptions). The DOM, usually HTML, acts as the data model and view in a typical model-view-controller relationship, and JavaScript acts as the controller by manipulating the style and content of the displayed data. The user agent conveys relevant information to the operating system's accessibility API, which can be used by any assistive technologies, such as screen readers.</p>

		<p>In addition to the prose documentation, the role taxonomy is provided in <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-features-20040210/">Web Ontology Language (OWL)</a></cite> [<cite><a href="references#ref_OWL">OWL</a></cite>], which is expressed in <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a></cite> [<cite><a href="references#ref_RDF">RDF</a></cite>]. Tools can use these to validate the implementation of roles in a given content document. For example, instances of some roles are expected to be children of a specific parent role. Also, some roles may support a specific <a href="terms#def_state" class="termref">state</a> or <a href="terms#def_property" class="termref">property</a> that another role does not support.</p>
		<p class="note" role="note">Note: The use of <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr>/OWL as a formal representation of roles may be used to support future extensibility. Standard RDF/OWL mechanisms can be used to define new roles that inherit from the roles defined in this specification. The mechanism to define and use role extensions in an interoperable manner, however, is not defined by this specification. A future version of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is expected to define how to extend roles.</p>
		<p>Users of alternate input devices need <a href="terms#def_keyboard_accessible" class="termref">keyboard accessible</a> content. The new semantics, when combined with the recommended keyboard interactions provided in <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-wai-aria-practices-20130307/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices</a></cite> [<cite><a href="references#ref_ARIA-PRACTICES">ARIA-PRACTICES</a></cite>], will allow alternate input solutions to facilitate command and control via an alternate input solution.</p>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> introduces navigational <a href="terms#def_landmark" class="termref">landmarks</a> through its taxonomy and the <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> role landmarks, which can help persons with dexterity and vision impairments by providing for improved keyboard navigation. <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> may also be used to assist persons with cognitive learning disabilities. The additional semantics allow authors to restructure and substitute alternative content as needed.</p>
		<p><a href="terms#def_at" class="termref">Assistive technologies</a> need the ability to support alternative inputs by getting and setting the current value of <a href="terms#def_widget" class="termref">widget</a> states and properties. Assistive technologies also need to determine what <a href="terms#def_object" class="termref">objects</a> are selected and manage widgets that allow multiple selections, such as list boxes and grids.</p>
		<p>Speech-based command and control systems can benefit from <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics like the <code>role</code> attribute to assist in conveying audio information to the user. For example, by determining that an element has a role of <a class="role-reference" href="roles#menu"><code>menu</code></a> and that it contains three elements with the role <a class="role-reference" href="roles#menuitem"><code>menuitem</code></a> each containing text content representing a different flavor, a speech system might state to the user that, "Select one of three choices: chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla."</p>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is intended to be used as a supplement for native language semantics, not a replacement. When the host language provides a feature that provides equivalent accessibility to the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature, use the host language feature. <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> should only be used in cases where the host language lacks the needed <a href="terms#def_role" class="termref">role</a>, <a href="terms#def_state" class="termref">state</a>, and <a href="terms#def_property" class="termref">property</a> indicators. Use a host language feature that is as similar as possible to the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature, then refine the meaning by adding <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>. For instance, a multi-selectable grid could be implemented as a table, and then <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> used to clarify that it is an interactive grid, not just a static data table. This allows for the best possible fallback for user agents that do not support <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and preserves the integrity of the host language semantics.</p>

		<p>This specification defines the basic model for <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, including roles, states, properties, and values. It impacts several audiences:</p>
		<ul><li><a href="terms#def_useragent" class="termref">User agents</a> that process content containing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> features;</li><li><a href="terms#def_at" class="termref">Assistive technologies</a> that present content in special ways to user with disabilities;</li><li>Authors who create content;</li><li>Authoring tools that help authors create conforming content; and</li><li>Conformance checkers that verify appropriate use of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.</li></ul>

		<h2 id="ua-support_header"><span class="tocnum">1.3. </span> User Agent Support</h2><p class="permalink"><a href="introduction#ua-support" title="Permalink for User Agent Support">#</a></p>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> relies on user agent support for its features in two ways:</p>	
		<ul><li>Mainstream <a href="terms#def_useragent" class="termref">user agents</a> use <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> to alter how host language features are exposed to <a href="terms#def_accessibility_api" class="termref">accessibility APIs</a> in order to improve accessibility. The mechanism for this is defined in the <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-wai-aria-implementation-20140320/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> User Agent Implementation Guide</a></cite> [<cite><a href="references#ref_ARIA-IMPLEMENTATION">ARIA-IMPLEMENTATION</a></cite>].</li><li><a href="terms#def_at" class="termref">Assistive technologies</a> use the enhanced information available in an accessibility API, or uses the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup directly via the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>, to convey semantic and interaction information to the user.</li></ul>
		<p>Aside from using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup to improve what is exposed to accessibility APIs, user agents behave as they would natively. Assistive technologies react to the extra information in the accessibility API as they already do for the same information on non-web content. User agents that are not assistive technologies, however, need do nothing beyond providing appropriate updates to the accessibility API.</p>
		<p>The <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> specification neither requires or forbids user agents from enhancing native presentation and interaction behaviors on the basis of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup. Mainstream user agents might expose <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> navigational landmarks (for example, as a dialog box or through a keyboard command) with the intention to facilitate navigation for all users. User agents are encouraged to maximize their usefulness to users, including users without disabilities. </p>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is intended to provide missing semantics so that the intent of the author may be conveyed to assistive technologies. Generally, authors using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> will provide the appropriate presentation and interaction features. Over time, host languages may add <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> equivalents, such as new form controls, that are implemented as standard accessible user interface controls by the user agent. This allows authors to use them instead of custom <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> enabled user interface components. In this case the user agent would support the native host language feature. Developers of host languages that implement <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> are advised to continue supporting <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics when they do not adversely conflict with implicit host language semantics, as <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics more clearly reflect the intent of the author if the host language features are inadequate to meet the author's needs.</p>

	<div class="section" id="co-evolution" role="region" aria-labelledby="co-evolution_header">
		<h2 id="co-evolution_header"><span class="tocnum">1.4. </span> Co-Evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Host Languages</h2><p class="permalink"><a href="introduction#co-evolution" title="Permalink for Co-Evolution of WAI-ARIA and Host Languages">#</a></p>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is intended to augment semantics in supporting languages like <a href="references#ref_HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="references#ref_SVG">SVG</a>, or to be used as an accessibility enhancement technology in other markup-based languages that do not explicitly include support for ARIA. It clarifies semantics to assistive technologies when authors create new types of objects, via style and script, that are not yet directly supported by the language of the page, because the invention of new types of objects is faster than standardized support for them appears in web languages.</p>
		<p>It is not appropriate to create objects with style and script when the host language provides a semantic element for that type of objects. While <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can improve the accessibility of these objects, accessibility is best provided by allowing the user agent to handle the object natively. For example, it's better to use an <code>h1</code> element in HTML than to use the <a class="role-reference" href="roles#heading"><code>heading</code></a> role on a <code>div</code> element.</p>
		<p>It is expected that, over time, host languages will evolve to provide semantics for objects that currently can only be declared with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>. This is natural and desirable, as one goal of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is to help stimulate the emergence of more semantic and accessible markup. When native semantics for a given feature become available, it is appropriate for authors to use the native feature and stop using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> for that feature. Legacy content may continue to use <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, however, so the need for user agents to support <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> remains.</p>
		<p>While specific features of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> may lose importance over time, the general possibility of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> to add semantics to web pages is expected to be a persistent need. Host languages may not implement all the semantics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> provides, and various host languages may implement different subsets of the features. New types of objects are continually being developed, and one goal of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is to provide a way to make such objects accessible, because web authoring practices often advance faster than host language standards. In this way, <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and host languages both evolve together but at different rates.</p>
		<p>Some host languages exist to create semantics for features other than the user interface. For example, SVG expresses the semantics behind production of graphical objects, not of user interface components that those objects may represent; XForms provides semantics for form controls and does not provide wider user interface features. Host languages such as these might, by design, not provide native semantics that map to <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> features. In these cases, <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> could be adopted as a long-term approach to add semantic information to user interface components.</p>

			<p>Many of the requirements in the definitions of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a href="terms#def_role" class="termref">roles</a>, <a href="terms#def_state" class="termref">states</a>, and <a href="terms#def_property" class="termref">properties</a> can be checked automatically during the development process, similar to other quality control processes used for validating code. To assist authors who are creating custom widgets, authoring tools may compare widget roles, states, and properties to those supported in <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> as well as those supported in related and cross-referenced roles, states, and properties. Authoring tools may notify authors of errors in widget design patterns, and may also prompt developers for information that cannot be determined from context alone. For example, a scripting library can determine the labels for the tree items in a tree view, but would need to prompt the author to label the entire tree. To help authors visualize a logical accessibility structure, an authoring environment might provide an outline view of a web resource based on the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup.</p>
			<p>In HTML, <code>tabindex</code> is an important way browsers support keyboard <a href="host_languages#host_general_focus">focus navigation</a> for implementations of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>; authoring and debugging tools may check to make sure <code>tabindex</code> values are properly set. For example, error conditions may include cases where more than one treeitem in a tree has a <code>tabindex</code> value greater than or equal to 0, where <code>tabindex</code> is not set on any treeitem, or where <code>aria-activedescendant</code> is not defined when the element with the role tree has a <code>tabindex</code> value of greater than or equal to 0.</p>

Most assistive technologies interact with user agents, like other applications, through a recognized accessibility API. Perceivable objects in the user interface are exposed to assistive technologies as accessible objects, defined by the accessibility API interfaces. To do this properly, accessibility information – role, states, properties as well as contextual information – needs to be accurately conveyed to the assistive technologies through the accessibility API. When a state change occurs, the user agent provides the appropriate event notification to the accessibility API. Contextual information, in many host languages like HTML, can be determined from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> itself as it provides a contextual tree hierarchy.</p>
		<p>While some assistive technologies interact with these accessibility APIs, others may access the content directly from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>. These technologies can restructure, simplify, style, or reflow the content to help a different set of users. Common use cases for these types of adaptations may be the aging population, persons with cognitive impairments, or persons in environments that interfere with use of their tools. For example, the availability of regional navigational landmarks may allow for a mobile device adaptation that shows only portions of the content at any one time based on its semantics. This could reduce the amount of information the user needed to process at any one time. In other situations it may be appropriate to replace a custom user interface control with something that is easier to navigate with a keyboard, or touch screen device.</p>
